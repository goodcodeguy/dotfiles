# Sharktank

These are my dotfiles, based loosely on Oh-MyFish.  If you wish to use them use the instructions below:

## Installation

Super simple installation right now since there isn't a whole lot to deal with.

    $ git clone git@github.com:goodcodeguy/dotfiles.git ~/.sharktank
    $ cd ~/.sharktank
    $ script/bootstrap
